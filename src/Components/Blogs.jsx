              What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
              where should we store them on the client-side?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-center">
              Access tokens and refresh tokens are used to authenticate users
              and grant them access to resources. Access Token are short-lived
              and are used to make authenticated requests to a resource server.
              Refresh tokens are longer-lived and can be used to obtain new
              access tokens when the old ones expire. We should store them in
              HTTP only cookie. But we also store them in local storage or
              session storage.
